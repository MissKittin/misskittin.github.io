And here were the design mistakes made:</p><ol><li>WordPress is a cool application but a terrible framework - it works well, has a theme and plugin system but WordPress code is like old versions of PHP, don't imitate that style</li><li>no public directory: there is an <code>index.php</code> file in it which initializes the entire application and the application itself is hidden a directory lower - the visitor will not enter there</li><li>poor coding style</li><li>PHP code mixed with HTML - <strong>DON'T DO THAT!</strong> Use MVC</li><li>PHP close tag: you have to be careful with this - there is a reason why PSR does not allow the closing tag</li><li>flat file database: poorly designed, the more posts the slower - <del>potential</del> bottleneck</li><li>setup procedure - there shouldn't be one</li><li>config via global array</li><li>security: PHP is a language that allows you to do stupid things - the administration panel lacks attention to this</li><li>welded to specific HTML classes (inflexible)</li></ol><p>The last mistake was that I had too few articles for the CMS to make sense - that's why Bash SSG received the updates and not Simpleblog.</p><p>Despite the design mistakes I made, I learned a few things and the best thing: I created my own website template (frontend is not my strongest point).</p></div><div id="xp2vdi" class="post"><div class="post-tags">Shell</div><div class="post-date">GPL-3.0</div><div class="post-title"><a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/MissKittin/xp2vdi">XP2VDI</a></div><p class="quotation">Easily convert an existing Windows installation to a virtual machine image</p><p>Three scripts:</p><ol><li>creates a disk image</li><li>installs the IDE drivers, in MS Windows 2000/2003/XP installation in a disk image using the chntpw <code>reged</code> program <strong>from Linux</strong></li><li>automates the whole process</li></ol></div><div id="server-admin-page" class="post"><div class="post-tags">PHP/Shell</div><div class="post-date">GPL-3.0</div><div class="post-title"><a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/MissKittin/server-admin-page">Server admin page</a></div><p class="quotation">Modular web admin panel</p><p>One of many projects that was created as part of Debian router. The application allows you to change system settings, view logs and machine status, as well as control the local network (BAN FOR THE DISRESPECTIVE) since my server also acts as a router.</p><p>The idea comes from 2017, when I converted my old PC into a NAS server. With this application I could mount disks and also check the amount of free space (since the project cost me 0 ojro). <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/MissKittin/nas-admin-page">You can see the NAS admin page repository here</a>.</p><p>That's when I also invented <code>acpid-autosuspend.sh</code> and <code>acpid-choice.sh</code>, which are currently in the <a href="/projects#acpid-mods"><code>acpid-mods</code></a> package (we need to save electricity - be green, Pepe the frog knows that, just ask him).</p><p>I made an application for my router in the same way, <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/MissKittin/server-admin-page-v2">you can see it here</a>. The more tools I created, the bigger the mess it became. I decided to move my programs to packages.</p><p>And here was the problem: the app was a monolith. So I redesigned the app so that every single thing was done by a single module. <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/MissKittin/server-admin-page-modules">You can find modules for the server admin page here</a>.</p><img class="img-center" loading="lazy" src="https://github.com/MissKittin/server-admin-page/blob/master/preview_dark.png?raw=true" alt="preview"><p>The application is designed for the PHP built-in HTTP server - you do not need a separate daemon like Apache or Nginx.</p><p>I decided that it doesn't make sense to maintain two repositories for one code.

The first releases (2009-2012) used Xfce4 and GTK+ 2.</p><a target="_blank" href="/media/lesslinux-screenshot_20090626-104210.png"><img class="img-center" loading="lazy" src="/media/lesslinux-screenshot_20090626-104210_sml.png" alt="screenshot1"></a><p>The system had several tools written in Ruby to facilitate the use of tools run only from the terminal.

This is the same protection as file execution permissions - you can bypass it in several ways, e.g. instead of <code>./script.sh</code> just type <code>bash ./script.sh</code> (it's similar with programs: <code>/lib/ld-linux.so.2 /tmp/binary</code>)</p><p>Despite its flaws, this solution is interesting - it's simple.
